# CodeWes

This is the Official CodeWes website, a coding club at Wesleyan University.
Here, we're working on various group projects that include app, web, and game development. Many of our projects are designed to improve the quality of life of Wesleyan students. In addition, we organized hackathons each semester to figure out who's the best coder on campus.
